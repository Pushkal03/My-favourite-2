        <p>Coding is something I have been passionate about.This attraction for coding made me to do coding every day on my own.So my parents wanted me to own knowledge in the field of coding and encouraged me to join this course in white hat jr.The utmost Interesting aspect I find in this corse is completing projects.Now I am able to do coding in code.org, thunkable,scratch and code pen. I have done many apps like Greeting card maker, Dice rolling app and lots more.<br>The instructions a programmer writes when creating a program. Lines of code are the "source code" of the program, and one line may generate one machine instruction or several depending on the programming language. A line of code in assembly language is typically turned into one machine instruction. In a high-level language such as C++ or Java, one line of code generates a series of assembly language instructions, which results in multiple machine instructions.<br>A single line of code may call for the inclusion of a subroutine that can be of any size, so while lines of code are commonly used to measure the overall complexity of a program, the metric is not absolute. Comparisons can also be misleading if the programs are written in different languages. For example, 20 lines of code in Java might easily require 200 lines of code in assembly language.
